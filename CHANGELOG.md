## Improvements

- Change the way to sync the notes to notion for better debugging and error handling.

For now, if you have any error, you will see a notice in the top-right corner of the app. You can check the error message in the developer console (F12) for more details.

You can enter the developer console by pressing `option+cmd+I`(Mac) or `ctrl+shift+I`(Windows/Linux) in the app. 

You can also toggle the developer console from the menu `View -> Toggle Developer Tools`.
